Please keep an eye on our website for any possible updates.\n\nPlease note that we are not able to notify customers when an item becomes available for pre-order nor when it comes back in stock. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this.\n\nWe are sorry we are not able to give any more information in regards to this item and we thank you for your kind understanding.",

Customers who request too many cancellations decrease in rank, which can lead to account restrictions or permanent account closure. Usually, the orders team will keep an eye on this and close accounts that have too many cancellations. For this reason we also never tell customers that we accept cancellations or advise customers to cancel any orders.<br>\n☆ We do NOT tell the customers their Account Rank (Rank A~E), for rank A and B we can tell the customer that their account is in good standing, for Rank C customer we tell the customer that they should try to be a little more careful, for Rank D and E customers we can tell the customers that their account is not in very good standing and warn the customer that they need to be more careful when placing their orders.<br>\n☆ Exceptions: If the maker has made an announcement regarding design changes to an item, then we can accept cancellations from the customer, and in this case if we cancel the item from the customer’s order we use “キャンセル整理” as reason for the cancellation, processing the cancellation this way will not affect the customer’s rank."

In cases where the order has already been shipped, there is nothing we can do, and it is also clearly written that the order has been updated to DHL shipping in the payment request and on the payment page, and that the customer needs to update the shipping method before submitting their payment if they want to use a different shipping method.<br><br><i>Note: It is possible to use the same procedures for stopping DHL shipping for eBay customers.</i><br><br><b>DHL zone check</b><br><br>When an order is imported via DHL on FileMaker near check 送付先 section, there is a part called DHLゾーン.<br>The DHL zone is imported automatically in the system once the order is placed, a number will come out near that part and if the number is 1/2/4 it means that the zone was received correctly.<br>If there is any other number like 3 or 0, it will be needed to check with the customer the exact address.<br>Usually this is something done by order people, however the email the customer will reply to will be received from us.<br>They will inform us of the address expecting from us to update their order, but as the zone for DHL is calculated only when importing the order, you will need to tell them to go into \"Modify existing orders\" select the order and edit the address from there.<br>Then email us again, we will check in the next import if this time the zone was determined correctly by the system.<br><br><b>*Important*</b><br>When order people send an email regarding an incomplete shipping address, or the forwarding company shipping address, if the order is not paid and the customers reply with the correct and full address, always tell the customers to make the changes from their account.<br>If an order is not locked is still editable from their side and we cannot take any responsibility in case the edit is not processed correctly if they edit it by themselves.<br>Never edit something from our side if the order is still open and can be touched by the customers.<br><br><br><b>Weight difference</b><br><br>In summary, DHL is faster than any other shipping method we have, however, the shipping cost most of the time is very high because DHL does not use the actual weight to determine the shipping fee but the \"volumetric weight\".<br>As in, the package cost relies on how much space the package occupies in the aircraft therefore if an item is light but very large, it is likely that DHL shipping fee will be high.<br>If the item is very heavy but not that big, the cost might be acceptable.<br>Explain the customer exactly the difference between the calculation between shipping fees for the other shipping method and DHL because they tend to not understand this part and are always shocked after finding out the shipping fee for DHL.<br>The link to rely for the explanation is on DHL website and explains how to calculate the volumetric weight.<br>http://www.dhl.com/en/tools/volumetric_weight_express.html<br><br>The size you need to rely is not the size of the box you see on FM but the outer size of the boxes.<br>Refer to the chart you have been given for those measures.<br><br><br><b>Notices from DHL JAPAN</b><br><br>After we ship orders, we might receive emails/telephone calls from DHL staff in Japan related to the shipments if there is any error in the address/the package is undeliverable/the customer cannot be reached on the number provided.<br>In that case take the phone call, ask for the Waybill number, hear what the problem is about and then you will have to write on the order 備考欄 the name of the person from DHL you are taking to and their telephone number.<br>They will require probably some additional information or a correction in the address, you will have first to contact the customer using the email address on the order, explain the issue and ask the customer to contact their local DHL service and reply us too giving us the information we required.<br>Once you receive the information requested, you will have to call back the DHL person and inform them too of the correction. *Generally we mostly receive requests through email.<br><br>For the other request for information, undervalue, credit card problems, check the Main template on FirstClass.<br>There are all the answers to the most common questions we receive."

Furthermore, we also require that the customer contacts us within a reasonable time from that they received their package, within 2 weeks from the delivery date.<br>\nIf the customer does not include the shipping label or order invoice in their photos, or if the customer waits to long with contacting us, then we would normally not assist the customer, but we are not to strict with these rules, and <i>one time exceptions</i> are generally acceptable if the issue is very clear and the customer has a specific reason for not being able to provide the information as requested, for example if the customer was traveling then maybe they could not open and check their order within 2 weeks, or they may have missed checking the items carefully enough before throwing away the shipping documents, in these cases we try to assist the customer, but we also make sure to explain that the customer needs to check their items more carefully in the future.<br>\nIn general, if the issue is very minor and the customer do not include the shipping documents in their photos, then we are not able to provide any assistance, and if it has been over 2 months since the order was delivered, then we also are not able to provide any assistance. *For special cases and claims, consult with a superior on what to do.<br><br>\n\n<b>Step 2: Confirm what assistance that can be provided</b><br>\nAfter the customer has provided us with a valid case according to <i>Step 1</i>, we need to confirm what assistance that we can provide. This step usually involves confirming with the customer if they are able to fix the issue them self, or if that is not possible, confirming if the affected part is a detachable part on the item, or for damages, we may also need to confirm if there were any visible box damages.<br>\nSome advises that we can provide the customer regarding fixing the items them self are as following:\n<ul>\n <li>Minor paint marks: Try to gently rub on the mark with a white plastic eraser</li>\n <li>Dirt: Try to wipe it of with a damp cloth</li>\n <li>Tight fitting parts: Try to slightly warm up the plastic, in particular for cases where the feets on a figure does not line up perfectly with the holes on the base, this solution usually works very well</li>\n <li>Detached/Loose parts: Try to re-attach the parts</li>\n <li>Lights/Sound does not work: Try to replace the batteries with brand new batteries</li>\n <li>Software issues for movies/games: Try with some other software or try on a different device</li>\n <li>Lost/Undelivered packages: Try to contact their local postal office, as it is quite common with cases where the package is waiting for the customer to complete some import procedures, or the package is waiting to be picked up at the postal office</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Step 3: Offer to assist the customer</b><br>\nAfter you have confirmed the problem, and you have confirmed what part the customer needs assistance with, we can provide the following types of assistance:\n<ul>\n <li>Sending a replacement part: commonly done for missing part, and when the defect part is a detachable part from the item</li>\n <li>Exchange: commonly done for clearly defect items where the defect parts are not detachable</li>\n <li>Return for refund: ...</li>\n <li>Partial refund: ...</li>\n <li>Send a replacement item: ...</li>\n <li>Damage investigation: ...</li>\n <li>Lost package investigation: ...</li>\n <li>Refuse to assist: ...</li>\n</ul>\n<i>*Note: For cases where we do not require for the customer to return the defect item, it is extra important to confirm the issue with the item together with either the shipping label or the order invoice.</i>\n\n<b>Step 4: Confirm that the case has been completed</b><br>\n"

There are also a couple of more situations when we need to refund our customers, and for processing refunds we have the following options.<br><br><b>Standard refund methods:</b><br>☆PayPal, this is the method we use the most and our preferred refund method.<br>It is possible to process partial and full refunds through PayPal. If the customer used PayPal as payment method for their order and it is within 100 days from the payment date, then we can process the refund directly from the customers payment, and the customer usually can confirm their refund on their PayPal account within 24 hours.<br>PayPal direct refunds are processed by Masuda and Wan.<br>If the customer did not pay through PayPal or if it has been more than 100 days since the payment date, then we are still able to submit refunds through PayPal if we have the customers PayPal email address and the account holder name, so we often ask for customers to provide us with these details. The refund process in this case is that first the orders team prepares the refund documents, which they hand over to Masuda for approval, and then Masuda hands over the documents to our Accounting department that process the refund on PayPal. As the refund process is a little more complicated than direct refunds, it can often take up to a few weeks before the customer receives their refunds, and during busy periods refund times at around a month or more is quite common.<br>☆Alipay, if the customer submitted their payment through Alipay, then it is possible for us to process partial and full refunds from the original payment, it is however important to first confirm with Nick that it is still possible to process a refund from the particular payment.<br>☆Unionpay, same as for Alipay.<br>☆Credit Card, for Credit Card it is only possible to process full refunds from the original payment, and     Credit Card refunds are processed by Masuda and Kubota. For Credit Card refunds there is also a time limit which varies case by case, but in most cases the time limit is much longer than what it is for PayPal, so in most cases where we would possible provide the customer with a full refund the time limit is usually not a problem.<br><br>All the methods mentioned above are standard refund methods, which means that you do not need to ask for permission to process a refund through these methods, if however you are unsure if we should refund the customer or not, or if you are unsure on how much we should refund the customer, then first consult with someone else before processing the case any further.<br><br><b>Special refund methods:</b><br>☆AmiAmi point refund, it is possible for us to add AmiAmi points to customers accounts, so we are able to process refunds as AmiAmi points, however, using AmiAmi points as a form of currency, does imply some strict laws on how the points are handled, so we generally never process any refunds as AmiAmi points. For very small refunds, and if the customer has upcoming orders, then it is fine to process a refund as AmiAmi points, please make sure to report to a superior if you process a refund this way, and if you wish to process a larger refund as AmiAmi points, then you first need approval from Masuda.<br>☆Discount on other order refund, we usually never use this method to process any refunds, as it can be confusing, approval from Masuda is necessary before processing any refunds this way.<br>☆Credit Card full refund, re-invoice for partial cost, in the end this is the same as doing a partial refund through Credit Card, as this method includes a step where the customer need to pay again, it is easy for there to be miss understandings, so usually we only consider this method if no other methods are available. If processing a refund this way, you first need to get approval from Masuda to process the refund this way, after that you need to clearly explain to the customer that we would like to provide a full refund and ask for the customer to re-submit a partial payment, please make sure that the customer understands the refund process before you proceed with refunding the payment.<br>☆Bank transfer, the transaction fee is very high for Bank transfers, so we usually never use this refund option. Only consider this option if there are no other alternatives, and the amount to refund is quite high, you need approval from Masuda to process a refund using this method.<br><br>All the special refund methods above require approval prior approval before processing the refund, and we never tell the customer about these options before we have received approval to process a refund using any of these methods. AmiAmi point refund for very small amounts do not need prior approval, but you need to report if you have processed a refund this way."

The processing times for chargeback cases can vary a lot, and in some cases it can take up to 2-3 months before the case is resolved. *Generally there is not many updates for chargeback cases.<br><br><b>Dispute:</b> There are 2 different types of disputes “Package did not arrive” and “The item is different from the description”. “Package did not arrive” is quite common for delayed and returned packages, and “The item is different from the description” is common for defect and damaged items, the procedures in these cases are the same as our regular procedures and we generally do not provide any special treatment, we do however try to be a little nicer and explain the situation to the customer, as we want to avoid for the dispute to escalate into a claim. The processing time for disputes are never longer than 3 weeks, which is because, if the dispute has not been closed before 3 weeks has passed and the customer did not escalate the dispute into a claim, then PayPal automatically closes the dispute in our store’s favor. *Some customers may feel forced into escalating the dispute into a claim due to this time limit, but we generally do not provide any special treatment because the customer is having a hard time trusting our store.<br><i>The hardest part with convincing a customer to close a dispute is the fact that PayPal advises against closing any disputes until the issue has been completely resolved, and the customer is <b>not able to re-open</b> any closed disputes.</i><br><br><b>Claim:</b> While a dispute is opened, the customer can at any point escalate the dispute into a claim. By our store’s policy, escalating a dispute into a claim is considered as the customer is not agreeing to the rules on our website, so in this case we always permanently close the customer’s account. The processing time for claims is usually around a week, which is the time that PayPal gives us to respond to the claim."

          "We have 3 different phone lines to keep an eye on:<br><ol><li>Customer phone line (Open between 12:00-17:00 JST on normal weekdays)</li><li>CS課国際Company phone line (Always open)</li><li>Your personal internal phone line (Always open)</li></ol><br><b>Customer phone line</b><br>Customer line phone number: 03-3813-5851 or +81 3-3813-5851<br>Open: Mon.-Fri. 12:00-17:00 JST,except Japanese holidays<br><br>On average, the Customer Support team on the international side may receive about 1-2 phone calls a day. Most of the time, English speaking customers call us seeking assistance regarding their orders. On rare occasions, such as some Chinese or Korean customers, they may call in speaking Japanese. We can only assist customers in English or Japanese.<br>☆If a customer calls in speaking Japanese, please try to assist the customer in Japanese only. Please try not to switch to English, or any other language. If you are having trouble assisting a customer, put the customer on hold by pressing the yellow【保留】button, and ask another CS team member for assistance.<br><br>Please try refraining from assisting customers in any other languages, even if you are fluent or native in that language. The main reason is because it helps customers be better prepared if they call us in a language every CS team member can understand. If a customer calls in requesting assistance in a foreign language, and you assist them in that language, the next time the customer calls you may not be present to assist the customer. If we are not able to transfer the customer to someone who speaks that language, they can get very frustrated, and it could lead to poor customer service.<br>In order to avoid such situations, please only assist customers in either English or Japanese.<br><br>Any phone calls received that are not from within the company are referred to as 外線（がいせん）. Though AmiAmi receives phone calls from a variety of sources, the phone calls the CS team handles are customer phone calls. There is a very specific number we advertise on our website that leads customer calls directly to our phones. It will have a distinct ring tone to it, so you can easily recognize it.<br><br><b>Greetings</b><br>If the phone rings, first pick up the phone, and press the blinking「1」button. This will connect you to the line the customer is calling from.<br><br>Normally, we greet the customers in English, as most of our customers do not understand Japanese.<br><br>For English greetings, you can start the phone call with any of the following:<br><br>“Thank you for calling, this is AmiAmi. How may I help you today?”<br>or<br>“Thank you for calling, this is AmiAmi.”<br>or<br>“Thank you for calling AmiAmi. How can I help you?”<br><br>Feel free to get creative.<br><br>A simple Japanese greeting would be:<br>「お電話ありがとうございます。あみあみでございます。」<br>☆Always speak to the customer in 敬語.<br><br><b>Confirm their Identity</b><br>After you greet the customer, they will most likely explain what they are having issues with. Before you assist the customer, however, you must confirm their identity.<br><br>The easiest way we do this is by asking the customer to provide us with their order number. Once you open the order, ask the customer for their name.<br>☆Make sure you are using formal English when speaking to the customer. Do not ask “What is your name?”, make sure to ask “Could you please tell me your name?”, or “Could I ask for your name please?” etc.<br><br>Once the customer tells you his name, and you confirm that it matches the order, you can then assist them with their problem.<br><br><b>Ending a Phone Call</b><br>At the end of the phone call, when you have assisted the customer with their issue and they are satisfied, always make sure to ask if there is anything else you can assist them with. For example, you can say things like:<br><br>    “Do you have any other questions?”<br>    or<br>    “Is there anything else I can assist you with today?”<br><br>If the customer is satisfied and replies with a “no”, you can then end the phone call. A common way to end the phone call is with the following phrase:<br>    <br>    “Thank you for calling (AmiAmi), have a nice day.”<br><br>Feel free to get creative.<br><br><b>Assistance in Japanese</b><br>The rules for assisting customer phone calls in Japanese is the same as English. First, confirm their identity, help with their issue, then politely end the call.<br><br>    Always speak to the customer in 敬語<br><br>This means not simply ending sentences with ～です, but ending with ~でございます.<br><br>When asking a customer to confirm something, or to tell you something, make sure to end the sentence with ～いただけますでしょうか. For example:<br><br>    ご注文番号を教えていただけますでしょうか。<br>    お名前を教えていただけますでしょうか。    Etc.<br><br>Make sure not to forget to add honorific particles before nouns whenever possible.<br><br>When apologizing to the customer, do not use すみません, use 大変申し訳ござません, or 申し訳ござません.<br>It’s also good to use that phrase when rejecting the customer’s request, or informing a disappointing fact to the customer. 「大変申し訳御座いませんが。。」<br><br>In order to end a Japanese phone call, try to repeat the phrases in the following order:<br><br>①Is there anything else I can help you with?<br>他に何かご不明な点がございますでしょうか。<br>(the customer says no)<br>②Thank you for calling.<br>お電話いただき誠に有り難う御座いました。失礼します。<br><br>Always try to say 失礼いたします before ending the call.<br><br>Most CS課国際 members, and most customers that calls in Japanese do not speak Japanese as their first language. So it is okay if your Japanese is not perfect, and sometimes you may make mistakes, but practice makes perfect!<br><br><b>CS課国際Company phone line</b><br>Company line phone number: 03-3813-5853<br>Open: Always when staff is available<br><br>Our second 外線（がいせん） is our CS課国際 Company phone line, this line is often used by our logistics department, Japan Post and other companies that needs to contact CS課国際. Most often these phone calls are related to the work done by the orders team, so usually the orders team will pick up the phone calls on this line. If however no one is here from the orders team, then you need to pick up phone calls on this line as well. On this line you should always use Japanese, and a common greeting when picking up the phone would be “お電話ありがとうございます。大網株式会社でございます。”, the caller will then introduce them self and tell you why they are calling or who they want to talk to. If the person is here then forward the phone call as written below, if not then explain that the person is currently not here, and if you know when the person comes back you can inform the caller about that as well, and when the person gets back please inform them that they had a phone call, or write them a message on chatwork.<br>When forwarding phone calls on this line it is important that you get the name of the person that is calling and where they are calling from, as you need to forward this information to the person that you are forwarding the call to, and if the caller did not introduce them self properly, always ask who is calling and why they are calling, DO NOT forward any calls without knowing who is calling.<br><br>Examples on how you can confirm who is calling:<br>“失礼いたしますが、どちら様でしょうか”<br>“失礼いたしますが、ご条件は何でしょうか”<br><br><b>Personal internal phone line (内線)</b><br>These phone calls are specifically for you, please try to always pick up the phone after 1-2 signals at most, on the 3rd signal the caller will end the call if it is not a very urgent issue, for very urgent issues and if you are not here then anyone from the CS課国際 team should pick up the phone on the 4th signal, when picking up calls from others 内線 press “*” twice after you have picked up the phone, this way you can pick up the phone call from your own phone.<br><br>When you get a 内線 call that is directed to you, then it is not necessary to press any buttons in order to receive the call, but if you pick up a phone call from someone else 内線 as described above, you need to press the “*” button twice. Pick up the phone, and politely greet the employee that’s calling you.<br><br>Example:<br>    「お疲れ様です。CS課国際の(your name)です。」<br><br>Although 内線 calls are not as formal as customer phone calls, try to speak in polite Japanese (sentences ending in ～です, and -ます forms).<br><br>Before ending the call, make sure to always say 失礼します.<br><br><b>Forwarding Calls</b><br>Note: NEVER FORWARD any customer calls to staff other than the CS課国際 customer support team, and usually you should not forward any calls that you can deal with yourself, but if you think it would be “good customer support” to forward the call, then it is fine to make exceptions to this rule within the CS課国際 customer support team.<br><br>When forwarding a phone call, make sure to transfer the caller to an available line. There are buttons with small numbers on your phone. These are all forwarding lines. If one of these buttons has a blinking red light, it means the line is currently being occupied by another caller. Make sure to forward the person you are speaking with to an empty line (one that is not blinking).<br><br>Once you have forwarded the caller to the line, inform the person you are trying to forward the call which line they have to access in order to receive the call.<br><br>Example:<br>    You receive a call from a customer, but are having issues answering their questions. You ask the customer to please hold, and press the【保留】button.<br>    You can then press the empty line number “2”, and then inform another CS member they have a call waiting at “Line 2”.<br>☆Make sure to always inform the person who is calling, “a customer” in the example above, and if you already did confirm the customers order number or some other information it could be good to send this information on chatwork to make it easier for the person you are forwarding the call to.<br>*Please be careful to avoid write any personal customer information on chatwork, as described in the “CHATWORK” section."

In these cases it is important to explain to the customer that we are processing all cases as fast as we can, but unfortunately some type of cases do take longer time as more steps are required, and there may also be some waiting time required due to other customer having similar issues and it may take some time for us to process all cases, there may also be cases that are out of our control, investigations be Japan Post for example.
